# NOTE: I will not continue development on this project

Progress was way too slow, so I will abandon callasof in favour of [rulsof](https://codeberg.org/Logout/rulsof).
Feel free to fork this project if you want to continue. However, I kindly ask you to help me with rulsof instead.

# callasof
C wrapper library for the lsof utility. Roughly follows the interface of Unix::Lsof Perl library.
